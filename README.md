# pacmen-exercise
 ##This exercise was all about teaching us how to manipulate the DOM in order to move a PacMan figure across a webpage.
How to Run: To run this on your machine, you can simply drag the link to your web browser and the PacMan figure should automatically move across the page.
Roadmap of future improvements: In the future I would like to add more functionality or possibly more characters can be included and displayed.
License information: This project was created with MITx Pro women's cohort and is under their licensing.
